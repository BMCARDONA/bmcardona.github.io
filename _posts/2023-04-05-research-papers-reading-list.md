My reading list of Deep Learning (DL) research papers, books, and articles. These resources were gathered primarily from [this](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap) GitHub roadmap, in addition to Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).  

Here's the key: 
- ✅ = Did Read
- ✖️ = Reading/Didn't Read

### ImageNet Evolution（Deep Learning broke out from here）

- ✖️ "**Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks**." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2012. [[pdf]](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) 

- ✖️ "**Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition**." arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.1556 (2014). [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)

- ✖️ "**Going deeper with convolutions**." Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2015. [[pdf]](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf) 

- ✖️ "**Deep residual learning for image recognition**." arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03385 (2015). [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)
