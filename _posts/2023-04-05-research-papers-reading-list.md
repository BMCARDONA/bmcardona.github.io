A helpful [video](https://crossminds.ai/video/andrew-ng-how-to-read-research-papers-and-machine-learning-career-advice-600242af495ecadbf27b382e/) by Andrew Ng on reading research papers.

#### Long-term advice:
- Improve foundational skills through coursework and reading
    - For Coursework:
        - Andrew Ng's coursera courses.
    - Steady reading (say, 2-3 papers per year).
        - Don't work in short bursts, but don't work all the time .
    - Print copies of papers you'd like to read.
- Projects
    - Do meaningful work by creating one to two significant projects. (Many shallow projects is not impressive.)
    - Contribute to open source projects.
    - Improve programming ability.
- Specialize in a given field, but have some understanding of other fields as well ("T" shape). 
- Saturday morning problem
    - On Saturday mornings, you can...
        - Read paper.
        - Work on project.
        - Open source.
    - The secret: If you read 2 papers a week, you will have read 100 papers in one year. 
        - The key is to work consistently, and (to re-iterate) not in short bursts.
- Selecting a job
    - Work with great people on great projects.
    - Focus on...
        - The team you'll interact with (10 - 30 persons).
        - Manager.
        - Not on ``brand.''
- Finally...
    - Pick things that will teach you the most, and that will allow you to do important work.
#### Advice on reading a paper: 
- Read the paper in four passes: 
    - Read title, abstract, figures.
    - Read introduction, conclusion, figures, skip rest.
    - Read but skip/skim the math.
    - Read entire paper but skip parts you don't understand.

#### Questions to consider:
- What did the authors try to accomplish?
- What were the key elements of the approach?
- What can you use yourself?
- What other references do you want to follow?

#### How to understand the math
- Re-derive from scratch.

#### How to understand the code
- Run opensource code.
- Re-write from scratch.

#### General advice
- Choose area of interest.
- Generally speaking, if you read 15-20 papers on a given topic, you have a good understanding; 50-100 papers, a mastery-level understanding.
- Compile a list of papers/articles you'd like to read.
- Quickly scan (say 10%) of all papers.
- Read a few papers, skip a few papers, and then decide which ones to read more.

#### How to find the papers
- NeurIPS.
- ICLR.
- ICML.
