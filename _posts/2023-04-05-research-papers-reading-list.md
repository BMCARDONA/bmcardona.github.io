My reading list of Deep Learning (DL) research papers, books, and articles. These resources were collected primarily from [this GitHub roadmap](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap), in addition to Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).  

Here's the key: 
- ✅ = Read

___
