My reading list of Deep Learning (DL) research papers, books, and articles. These resources were gathered primarily from [this](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap) GitHub roadmap, in addition to Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).  

Here's the key: 
- âœ… = Read
