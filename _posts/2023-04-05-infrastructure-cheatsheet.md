This post was inspired by [Stephen Wolfram's 2019 post](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/).

> “Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster. Nobody in the history of humanity has ever achieved “work-life balance,” whatever that might be, and you certainly won’t get there by copying the “six things successful people do before 7:00 a.m.” The day will never arrive when you finally have everything under control—when the flood of emails has been contained; when your to-do lists have stopped getting longer; when you’re meeting all your obligations at work and in your home life; when nobody’s angry with you for missing a deadline or dropping the ball; and when the fully optimized person you’ve become can turn, at long last, to the things life is really supposed to be about. Let’s start by admitting defeat: none of this is ever going to happen. But you know what? That’s excellent news.” &mdash;Oliver Burkeman, *[Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Management-Mortals/dp/0374159122)*

## General Advice
- Instead of trying to learn something abstractly, pick a specific project you'd like to work on and learn as you go. This will make it much more clearer how certain information can be applied. 
<!-- - You don’t need to understand everything to start applying machine learning in a useful way (in fact, you might discover that almost all practitioners have knowledge gaps). -->

## Hacks
- Place no-snooze alarm clock out of arms reach. (This will push you to get out of bed.)
<!-- - Avoid late-night eating by brushing teeth after last meal.  -->
- Put away phone while reading; if unfamiliar with certain words, keep on hand a [physical dictionary](https://www.amazon.com/Paperback-Oxford-English-Dictionary-Dictionaries/dp/0199640947/ref=sr_1_1?crid=179MX4LD71LPV&keywords=oxford+dictionary&qid=1681314435&s=audible&sprefix=oxford+dictio%2Caudible%2C188&sr=1-1-catcorr). 
- Use a fan to drown out surrounding noise. Alternatively, play [white noise](https://open.spotify.com/track/5UBonaClAZVfzxJNn8nnhh?si=574507e8b3744f00) on loop.
- Don't use social media (this includes YouTube and Reddit). See [The Social Dilemma](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224).
