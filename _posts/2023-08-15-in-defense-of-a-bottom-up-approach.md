Having recently completed the [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_deep-learning_deeplearning-ai_FTCOF_specializations_country-US-country-CA&campaignid=904733485&adgroupid=148411448815&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=654837734383&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjwxOymBhAFEiwAnodBLPzAv2Q5VXwnHJSr0WPB5nzGMBfAgHnhBjHVr-LX7KNwcjHPa_TWQRoCkwIQAvD_BwE) (DL) Specialization offered by Andrew Ng and the team at DeepLearning.AI, and having recently started the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) (PDLC) course offered by Jeremy Howard and the team at fast.ai, I thought I would celebrate my thoughts on Ng's teaching style -- and why I think it's so effective.   

For anyone who has taken both courses, the DL specialization and the PDLC course will differ strikingly in one way: while the former emphasizes a "bottom-up" style of teaching, the latter emphasizes a "top-down" style of teaching. Though I can appreciate the merits of both approaches, I am very much glad that I completed the DL specialization prior to starting the PDLC course. And I say this not as someone who wants to detract from the PDLC course; to the extent that I have looked at its materials, the PDLC course seems like another great resource from which one can learn about deep learning. 

But Andrew Ng is out-and-out a *phenomenal* instructor. And one reason I enjoyed so much taking the DL specialization is that Ng does not exhibit any of the symptoms of the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge). Although Ng clearly has a strong grasp on deep learning concepts, he is able to convey his thoughts carefully at the level of a beginner, without neglecting material that is ostensibly trivial. ([This conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jspaMLxBig) between Ng and Lex Fridman speaks to Ng's sincerity in his approach to teaching his students. My favorite moment of the conversation is when Andrew emphasizes his intent to do what was is best for his *students*.) Ng's pedigree appears in no way to interfere with what he expects his students to understand; and, for that reason, he is able to gradually give one the confidence to transition from (say) vectorized implementations of neural networks, to, among other things, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers -- for which I am extremely grateful. 

Hence, the DL specialization and the PDLC course are seemingly each other's complements. Where Andrew provides the *foundational* skills one needs to *understand* the underpinnings of deep learning, Jeremy provides the *practical* skills one needs to implement deep learning models.
