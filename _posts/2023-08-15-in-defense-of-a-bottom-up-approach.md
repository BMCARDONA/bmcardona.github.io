Having recently completed the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_deep-learning_deeplearning-ai_FTCOF_specializations_country-US-country-CA&campaignid=904733485&adgroupid=148411448815&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=654837734383&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAjwxOymBhAFEiwAnodBLPzAv2Q5VXwnHJSr0WPB5nzGMBfAgHnhBjHVr-LX7KNwcjHPa_TWQRoCkwIQAvD_BwE) (DLS) by Andrew Ng and his team at DeepLearning.AI, and having recently started the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) (PDLC) course by Jeremy Howard and his team at fast.ai, I thought I would celebrate my thoughts on Ng's teaching style -- and why I think it's so effective.   

The DLS and PDLC course differ strikingly in one way: while the former emphasizes a "bottom-up" style of teaching, the latter emphasizes a "top-down" style of teaching. And though I can appreciate the merits of both approaches, I am happy to say that I completed the DLS prior to starting the PDLC course. And I say this not as someone who wants to detract from the PDLC course; to the contrary, to the extent that I have looked at its materials, the PDLC course seems like another great resource from which one can learn about deep learning. 

But... Andrew Ng is out-and-out a *phenomenal* instructor. And I think the one reason I loved learning from him is that he does not suffer from the symptoms of the "[curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)." Although Ng has a strong grasp on deep learning concepts, it is impressive how well he is able to convey his thoughts at the level of a complete novice. ([This conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jspaMLxBig) between Ng and Lex Fridman speaks to Ng's sincerity in teaching his students. My favorite moment of the conversation, in particular, is when Andrew emphasizes his intent to do what was is best for his *students*.) And I love that his pedigree in no way interferes with what he expects his students to understand; he is not hesitant, for example, to re-emphasize subtle points. For that reason, Andrew, in a piece-meal fashion, is able to give his students the confidence to transition seamlessly from vectorized implementations of neural networks, to, among other things, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformers -- for which I (and presumably many, many other students) are extremely grateful. 

Hence, the DLS and the PDLC course are seemingly each other's complements: Where Andrew provides the *foundational* skills one needs to *understand* deep learning, Jeremy provides the *practical* skills one needs to implement deep learning models.
