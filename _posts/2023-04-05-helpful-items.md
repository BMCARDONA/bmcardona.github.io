#### On desk
- Water
- Laptop

#### Advice
- Use a fan to drown out white noise. Alternatively, play [white noise](https://open.spotify.com/track/5UBonaClAZVfzxJNn8nnhh?si=574507e8b3744f00) on a streaming service. (If the latter, make sure to set it enable an enending loop.)
- Place morning alarm out of arms reach. 

#### Educational
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu) is a web based publication of virtually all MIT course content.
- [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) is an answer engine developed by Wolfram Research.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)
- [Coursera](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=coursera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

#### Leisure 
- Keep in touch with family and friends
- Read
- Listen to Sam Harris' [Making Sense](https://open.spotify.com/show/5rgumWEx4FsqIY8e1wJNAk?si=0597ac75f6b14d5d) podcast. 
- Listen to audio books. (I use a card from my local library to access thousands of audiobooks.)

#### Nightly routine
- Brush teeth early (say, around 6 PM) to avoid late-night eating.
- Use a [time-blocking journal](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Daily-Method-Distracted/dp/0593192052) to schedule the day from 8 AM to 6 PM. This journal has been *extremely* helpful to me. 
- When my time blocking ends, schedule the rest of the day. (The latter portion should used for shallow work.) 
- Prepare clothes for tomorrow
