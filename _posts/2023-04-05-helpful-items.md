This post was inspired by Stephen Wolfram's 2019 [post](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/02/seeking-the-productive-life-some-details-of-my-personal-infrastructure/).

#### Books/Items
- [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) by Cal Newport.
- [Waking Up](https://www.amazon.com/Waking-Up-Spirituality-Without-Religion/dp/1451636024) by Sam Harris.
- Sam Harris's [Waking Up App](https://www.wakingup.com).
- *This* [sleep mask](https://www.amazon.com/Contoured-Sleeping-Blindfold-Concave-Meditation/dp/B07KC5DWCC/ref=zg_bs_3764231_sccl_1/132-0947972-7044716?th=1).

#### On desk
- Water
- Candle
- Tea
- Lamp
- Pencil
- Notebook
- Laptop

#### Advice
- Use a fan to drown out white noise. Alternatively, play [white noise](https://open.spotify.com/track/5UBonaClAZVfzxJNn8nnhh?si=574507e8b3744f00) on a streaming service. (If you choose the latter, make sure to enable an unending loop.)
- Place alarm clock out of arms reach.
- Don't use social media (that includes YouTube and Reddit). See [The Social Dilemma](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224).

#### Educational
- [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu) is a web based publication of virtually all MIT course content.
- [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) is an answer engine developed by Wolfram Research.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) provides free, online educational content in a wide range of subjects, including math, science, history, economics, and computer science.
- [Coursera](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=coursera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) partners with top universities and organizations from around the world to provide high-quality educational content to learners of all backgrounds.

#### Leisure 
- Contact family and friends.
- Read NYT, books. (But never more than two books at once!)
- Listen to Sam Harris' [Making Sense](https://open.spotify.com/show/5rgumWEx4FsqIY8e1wJNAk?si=0597ac75f6b14d5d) podcast. 
- Listen to audio books. (I use a card from my local library to access thousands of audiobooks.)

#### Nightly routine
- Brush teeth after dinner to avoid late-night eating.
- Use a [time-blocking journal](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Block-Planner-Daily-Method-Distracted/dp/0593192052) to plan for tomorrow. (This journal has been *extremely* to me.)
- When time blocking ends, schedule the rest of the day. (The latter portion should used for shallow work, as opposed to [deep work](https://calnewport.com/some-notes-on-deep-working/).) 
- Prepare tomorrow's clothes.
