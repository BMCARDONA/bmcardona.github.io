As I am nearly finished with Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), I thought I would create a comprehensive post listing my completed assignments. This course has taught me a great deal about deep learning and its capabilities; I encourage anyone interested in the subject to take Ng's course. Enjoy! :)

### Disclaimer

If you are currently completing this specialization, I would strongly encourage you *not* to copy any of these solutions. This specialization is a treasure trove of information, and any hard work you put into it will doubtless be rewarded -- please don't take it for granted.
