As I am nearly finished with Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), I thought I would create a comprehensive post to show my completed assignments. Happy learning! :) 

## Programming Assignments

#### Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

- [W2A1 - Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/BMCARDONA/Deep-Learning-Specialization-Solutions/tree/main/1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/week_2/logistic_regression_with_a_neural_network_mindset)

### Disclaimer

If you are yourself currently completing the Deep Learning Specialization, I would highly discourage you from copying any of these solutions. This specialization is a treasure trove of information, and any hard work you put into it will doubtless be rewarded -- so please don't take it for granted! :)
