### Disclaimer

If you are yourself currently completing the Deep Learning Specialization, I would highly discourage you from copying any of these solutions. By completing each assignment in the specialization on your own, you will learn *much* more both about the subjects themselves, as well as any possible knowledge gaps that you still have. These assignments are a treasure trove -- don't take them for granted! :)
