A helpful [lecture](https://crossminds.ai/video/andrew-ng-how-to-read-research-papers-and-machine-learning-career-advice-600242af495ecadbf27b382e/) on reading research papers by Andrew Ng.

#### Long-term advice:
- Improve foundational skills through coursework and reading
    - For coursework:
        - Andrew Ng's coursera courses.
    - Steady reading (say, 2-3 papers per week).
        - Don't work in short bursts, but don't work all the time.
    - Print copies of papers you'd like to read.
- Projects
    - Do meaningful work by creating one to two significant projects. (Having many shallow projects is not impressive.)
    - Create and contribute to open-source projects.
    - Improve programming ability.
- Specialize in a given field, but have some understanding of other fields as well ("T" shape). 
- Saturday morning problem
    - On Saturday mornings, you can...
        - Read paper.
        - Work on project.
        - Work on open-source project.
    - The secret: If you read 2 papers a week, you will have read 100 papers in one year. 
        - The key is to work consistently, not in short bursts.
- Selecting a job
    - Work with great people, on great projects.
    - Focus on...
        - The team you'll interact with (10 - 30 persons).
        - Manager.
        - Not on ''brand.''
- Finally...
    - Pick things that will teach you the most, and that will allow you to do important work.

#### Advice on reading a paper: 
- Read each paper in four passes: 
    - Read title, abstract, figures.
    - Read introduction, conclusion, figures, skip rest.
    - Read but skip (or skim) the math (don't get bogged down by too many details!)
    - Read entire paper but skip parts you don't understand.

#### Questions to consider:
- What did the authors try to accomplish?
- What were the key elements of the approach?
- What can you use yourself?
- What other references do you want to follow?

#### How to understand the math
- Re-derive the math from scratch.

#### How to understand the code
- Run open-source code.
- Re-write the code from scratch.

#### General advice
- Choose area of interest. (Recall that you eventually need to specialize.)
- Generally speaking, if you read 15-20 papers on a given topic, you have a good understanding; 50-100 papers, a mastery-level understanding.
- Compile a list of papers/articles you'd like to read.
    - Quickly scan (say 10% of) all papers on list.
- Read a few papers, skip a few, and then decide which ones to read more.

#### How to find the papers
- NeurIPS.
- ICLR.
- ICML.
