1. Make your own project to show what you learned. Be sure to completely polish one project before moving to another one. In my case, it was reproducing superconvergence from Leslie Smith’s paper then the Deep painterly harmonization paper.
2. Write a blog to explain what you learned. It doesn’t have to be complex new research articles, start with the basics of a model even if you think there are thousands of articles like this already. You’ll learn a lot just by trying to explain things you thought you understood.
3. Contribute to a Deep Learning related open source project (like the fastai library).
4. Get into Kaggle competitions (still on my to-do list, maybe it’s going to be my 2019 resolution ;) ).
5. Get a Twitter account to tell people about all of the above.
